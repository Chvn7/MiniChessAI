    Gardner chess (5 by 5)

This game has roughly 9x(10^18) legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers.
Officially a weakly solved game (perfectly played leads to draw). So I'm not going for perfect game AI opponent.

    Some rules:

No Castling
Pawn rules:
Promotion Yes
Double-Step No
En Passant No
